# Hello world
This is a website I made while learning Nextjs - A React Framework

What I learned:
1. Routes
2. The elegancy of components
3. APIs
4. Mysql connection and query implementation in Javascript(really cool😎 )
5. Forms and Authentication
6. Loving JSON 😁

**But most important, I learnt a Javascript framework**

##To run:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

# For Jesus I code
